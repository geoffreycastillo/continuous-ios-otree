                Risks or discomforts from this research include answering questions about potentially sensitive topics
                and the
                possibility that we share your anonymized responses to these questions with other mTurk workers in
                future
                studies.

            <li>
                Taking part in this research project is voluntary.

            <strong>Voluntary participation and confidentiality:</strong>

            consequences. All decisions will be made anonymously.

            <strong>Risks:</strong>
            There are some risks you might experience from being in this study.
            One risk is being asked about potentially sensitive subjects.
            Another risk is the possibility of a breach of confidentiality.
            We might use your anonymized responses to the survey questions in future studies and it is possible that
            someone with high levels
            of technical skill and effort could determine your identity.
            We think this possibility is quite low and we will make efforts, should we use your responses, to keep them
            as anonymous as possible.
